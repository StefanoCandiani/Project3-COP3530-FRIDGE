# FRIDGE (Food and Recipes Indexing Database Generating Environment)
## Project 3, COP 3530
Nicolas Calafiore, Stefano Candiani, Tavienne Millner

## Motivation

  When it comes to home-cooking, recipe website users will generally spend a large amount of time looking for a recipe that matches the ingredients that one has at home. By prompting a user to identify the ingredients within their fridge, our project seeks to facilitate user accessibility to various recipes hosted by Food.com, highlighting those that have the closest match to the user specifications. 

  The overarching goal of this project is to conduct a comparison in the search algorithm of two implementatiosn of a hash map data structure our team would develop. These two implementations would differ in the collision management system where one would append data in a linked list system while the other in a self-balancing AVL tree system. The comparison would be conducted in terms of which system can find the first exact match the fastest.

## Build Status

This project is currently under development starting from around July 3th, 2024. Any major developments will be recorded below:
* July 3rd, 2024 - Project development initialized.
* July 16th, 2024 - Initial AVL tree implementation commit.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a more organized and less skewed version of the following dataset acquired at Kaggle.com
